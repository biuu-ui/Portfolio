                <p>Iâ€™m a Student at Singaperbangsa Karawang University.
                I majored in in information systems because I was interested in Technology. Especially design and coding.
                Sometimes I design poster and build my own website while I studying it. 
                Ultimately, seeing my ideas come to life is the thing that I enjoy the most about coding.
                I like listening to music and watching movies. I also a Kpop Fangirl and Thaienthu</p>
